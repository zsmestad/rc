My RC Files
===========

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/zsmestad/rc
```

Zsh
---

[Git-prompt][0] is now included as a submodule under a different directory to avoid conflicts.

Neovim
---

Included [Plug.vim][1] in repo, which seems to work best. I'm mainly using Neovim over Vim now, so most updates will be to `init.vim`.
